# blaupause ![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/fspoettel/blaupause.svg?maxAge=2592000?style=flat-square)

> Blaupause is a developer-friendly Hugo starter kit based around gulp-tasks. It comes es6-ready with several helpers for SVG and fonts and a nice basic structure for the html, scss and javascript. For a detailed listing of what is included, see "In the box".

## Installation

This project depends on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Node](http://nodejs.org/) being installed on your machine. To initiate a new site, do:

1. `git clone https://github.com/felics/blaupause project`
2. `cd project`
3. `npm install`
4. `gulp`

## In the box

* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)-based, automatic builds
* [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) live-reloading environment
* `Developer Mode` with `Sourcemaps` and debugging helpers
* `Production Mode` for optimized builds

### JS

* [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io)
* [Babel](babeljs.io)
* [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)
* [Unit tests via Ava with jsdom](https://github.com/avajs/ava)
* [Customizable Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/)

### SCSS

* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
* [Stylelint](http://stylelint.io/)
* (Optional) SASS boilerplate based on [SASS Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/),  [Sanitize.css](https://github.com/10up/sanitize.css) and a couple of useful mixins

### Static Site Generator

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)[1] with a minimal `layout`-boilerplate
* Recipes for common tasks in the README

### Images / SVG

* [svg-sprite](https://github.com/jkphl/svg-sprite) to generate SVG symbol sprites
* [imagemin](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin)

### And the rest

* [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/)
* [Travis](https://travis-ci.org)-based tests
* (Example) Automatic Travis deployment to Github Pages

[1] Due to the structure of this repository, **Hugo Themes are not supported**.

## Tasks & Configuration

### Basic Configuration

The build configuration is done in `./internals/gulp/config.js` and `./hugo/config.yaml`. A breakdown of the most important keys:

``` yaml
# ./hugo/config.yaml

# The baseurl of the build artifact. Note that this is ignored in development mode
baseurl: "http://fspoettel.github.io/blaupause/"

# The rest of the file is a "normal" Hugo config. Check the hugo docs to see how it works if you are not familiar with it
```

``` js
// ./gulp/config.js

// The directory that will contain the built page
const destinationPath = 'public';
// The directory that will contain all assets (css, js, img)
const assetPath = `${destinationPath}/static`;
// The source path that contains sass, es6 etc
const sourcePath = 'src';

// Changes the port and address the development server will be run at. Also changes Hugo `baseurl` in dev-mode
const host = 'localhost';
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// The rest of the file contains task specific configuration that you can tailor to your use-case, see below
```

### Tasks & Task Configuration

#### `gulp`

Generates an initial build and starts up BrowserSync. Rebuilds and reloads are automatically triggered whenever the source files change.

#### `gulp build`

(Re-)builds from `src` to `public`.

#### `gulp build:clean`

Removes the `public`-folder (executed on initial build and `gulp build`).

#### `gulp copy:build`

Copies files into the `public`-folder. By default, it will copy any stray files from the root directory of `src` to the root of `public`. The task can be extended with custom directives in the gulp config. Check out the `jQuery`-Recipe in the recipes section for a common use-case.

#### `gulp hugo:build`

The Hugo documentation can be found [here](http://gohugo.io/) and covers pretty much anything you need to know about the static site generator. The Hugo content and configuration can be found in `./hugo` while the layouts reside in `./src/layouts`. Please note that Hugo Themes are currently not supported.
In Development Mode, the `baseUrl` is replaced with the `localhost` used in BrowserSync. To generate a production-ready build with correct URLs, run `gulp build -p` or `gulp hugo:build -p` (see below).
Make sure to adjust `layoutdir` in `./hugo/config.yaml` if you decide to change `sourcePath` in the gulp-config.

#### `gulp images:build`

Optimizes the images in `./src/images` and copies them to `public`. The `imagemin`-settings and file-endings `imagemin` scans for can be configured in `./internals/gulp/config.js`.

#### `gulp images:clean`

Cleans up the files generated by the `images`-task.

#### `gulp modernizr:build`

Generates a custom Modernizr build with [Customizr](https://github.com/Modernizr/customizr). The task can be configured in `./internals/gulp/config.js`.

#### `gulp modernizr:clean`

Cleans up the Modernizr-build created by the `modernizr`-task.

#### `gulp scripts:build`

Transpiles and bundles `js`-files in `./src/scripts/*.js` via Webpack and Babel. The task can be configured in `./internals/gulp/config.js`. It is possible to specify `externals` here (see `jQuery` recipe for an example). You can further customize the Webpack config by editing  `./internals/gulp/tasks/scripts.js`.

#### `gulp scripts:clean`

Cleans up the script-bundles created by the `scripts`-task.

#### `gulp styles:build`

Compiles the `scss`-stylesheets in `./src/styles/*.scss` and automatically adds prefixes via `Autoprefixer`. You can specify the version ranges targeted by Autoprefixer in `./internals/gulp/tasks/scripts.js`. You can add PostCSS plugins in `./internals/gulp/tasks/styles.js`.

#### `gulp styles:clean`

Cleans up the stylesheets created by the `styles`-task.

#### `gulp svg:build`

Bundles all `.svg`-files in `./src/images` and compiles them into a symbol sprite. You can easily reference the generated sprites via the `image/svg` Hugo-partial (see below).

#### `gulp svg:clean`

Cleans up the svg sprite created by the `svg`-task.

### Production Builds

You can generate a production-ready build ("real" BaseURL, no drafts, no sourcemaps, `NODE_ENV = "production"` for JS builds, uglified code) by passing `-p` to any build task.

## Hugo Partials

#### image/svg

Reference a SVG-symbol from `/static/svg/sprite.symbol.svg#` by ID. SVGs are generated by `gulp svg:build` in the default build.

``` html
  <div class="icon">{{ partial "image/svg" (dict "id" "the-icon" "class" "optional-class") }}</div>
```

## Recipes

To keep the boilerplate as lean as possible, common tools such as jQuery have not been included in the base boilerplate as they are not needed for every use-case. The following recipes show how these tools can be integrated into the boilerplate efficiently.

### Adding jQuery with a fallback

``` bash
# Install jquery from npm
npm install --save jquery
```

``` js
// ./internals/gulp/config.js

const scripts = {
  // Allows you to import jQuery in your js files without adding it to your webpack bundle
  externals: {
    jquery: 'jQuery'
  },
};

// Copy the latest jQuery from node_modules to static/scripts/vendor
const copy = [
  {
    sourcePath: './node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js',
    destinationPath: `${assetPath}/scripts/vendor`,
  },
];
```

``` html
<!-- hugo/layouts/partial/html_foot.html -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js"></script>
<script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="{{ "static/scripts/vendor/jquery.min.js" | relURL }}"><\/script>')</script>
<script src="{{ "static/scripts/main.js" | relURL }}"></script>
```

``` js
// Use it in your bundle
import $ from 'jquery';

$(body).addClass('done');
```

## Adding tasks

You can add tasks by creating a `.js`-file in `.internals/gulp/tasks` that contains a task, a reference to `gulp` and the `gulp`-modules you want to use. You can then add it to the run-sequence in `build`.

## Deploy

The build product can be deployed practically anywhere since it is just a static html page. This repository serves as an example on how to deploy to `gh-pages`.

* `./hugo/config.yaml{baseurl}` is set to the real path of the site
* Travis is set up to automatically run `./internals/scripts/deploy.sh` after a successful build of the docs-branch. `deploy.sh` runs `gulp build -p` and force-pushes the build-folder to the `gh-pages`-branch (for more information on how to set up Travis-deployment to `gh-pages`, check out [steveklabnik/automatically_update_github_pages_with_travis_example](https://github.com/steveklabnik/automatically_update_github_pages_with_travis_example)).
