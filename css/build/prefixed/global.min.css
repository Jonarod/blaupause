/ // Handle with care!//--------------------------------- // * Base units // * Get the mixins first - they do no harm and may be needed by the config -> folder:scss/globals/mixins // * Get the global variables. -> folder:scss/globals/config // * Where are most of the reset-styles? Normalize.css is ingrained across the project as this makes the scope of the normalizations more visual. // * Get the layout files -> folder:scss/layout // * The grid is based on my fork of csswizardry-grids // * Get the typography -> folder:scss/globals/typography // * Get basic UI elements -> folder:scss/globals/elements // * Get the styles - these should contain project-specific globals,e.g. core-layout. -> folder:scss/globals // * Get the recipes // * Get local-stuff - page-styles,custom elements etc.
