// 1. Abstracts
// The `abstracts`-folder gathers SASS tools and helpers used across the project.
// Every global variable, function, mixin and placeholder should be put in here.
@import
  "abstracts/variables",
  "abstracts/functions/color",
  "abstracts/mixins/clearfix",
  "abstracts/mixins/webfont";

// 2. Vendors
// There is two ways to require vendor-files:
// - The `vendors`-folder can contain code from external libraries.
// - You can import directly from npm / bower by refeencing the approriate path
// If you have to overwrite sections of a vendor-file, use an `overwrites`-folder
@import
  "node_modules/family.scss/source/src/family",
  "node_modules/hagrid/scss/hagrid",
  "node_modules/modularscale-sass/stylesheets/modular-scale",
  "vendors/sanitize";

// 3. Base
// The `base`-folder holds the boilerplate code for the project.
// It contains a reset and animations-file as well as global typographic rules
@import
  "base/animations",
  "base/base",
  "base/typography";

// 4. Modules
// Modules are singular, composable abstractions. Your app should mostly be composed of them.
@import
  "modules/button";

// 5. Partials
// Partials are used to lay out your site.
@import
  "partials/header",
  "partials/footer";

// 6. Routes
// The `routes`-folder contains page-specific styles that can't be fit into modules or partials.
@import
  "routes/home";
